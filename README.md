### Date created
The date I created this project and readme is 2nd of July, 2019.

### Project Title
The project title is, "Explore US Bikeshare Data".

### Description
The project made use of Python to explore data related to bike share from three cities, "Chicago, New York City and Washington".

### Files used
In order to complete this project, I used a Python script named bikeshare.py, I also used the three city dataset files. The dataset used was provided by a bikeshare company named Motiva.

The dataset for all three cities were not the same, Washington dataset didn't contain the column; Gender and Birth Year, whereas, New York City and Chicago has those columns.

The columns start time, end time, start duration, trip duration, user type and end station were all the same for all three cities.
